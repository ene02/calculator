# ðŸ”¢Calculator
### A calculator that is completely useless
This is my first ever C# project, although the upload of this repo may say otherwise, thats becuase i found this project a few months ago and i though it was completly lost to time.

### What does it do?
**Calculator** provides a static class that can parse strings containing an arithmetical structure:
#### Addition (+) and subtraction (-):

    2+2-1
    Result: 3
### Multiplication (*) and Division (/):

    2*2/2
    Result: 2
### Roots (#) and Powers (^):

    2#4+2^2
    Result: 6
### Combine symbols and go crazy:

    10+2302*3â€‹âˆ’(2#16/2)*20/2/(1+1*2)*(âˆ’5)
    Result: 364,500,043.33

### What is that Root??

Ok, for some reason, the terminal didn't want to detect the proper symbol for square root, so i had to improvise, the symbol still works as expected tho, **Index** on the left and **Radicand** on the right
